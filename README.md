This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Tests

Frontend-only tests stay under the default test command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Real auth integration tests run separately:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Integration test requirements:

- Next frontend must already be running
- Strapi backend must already be running
- the frontend must be pointed at the real backend, not MSW
- a confirmed test user must already exist

Required env vars for the integration suite:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1337
INTEGRATION_TEST_EMAIL=confirmed-user@example.com
INTEGRATION_TEST_PASSWORD=Password123!
```

If you run the frontend in development mode, disable local mock auth before running integration tests:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MSW=false
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
